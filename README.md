GRADER TOOLS

This is a collection of scripts to use as a grader for courses CS162, CS163, CS202. 

Instructions:

1. Download zip file from D2L
2. Copy all scripts into directory with zip file
3. Either chmod to execute on all scripts
    or run sh fileHandlingScript.sh ZipFileName.
    
This will create a new directory of the zip files name.
Inside this directory will be multiple directories with the
names of each individual student and these directories will
contain all of the files that they submitted, a makefile, a grader
notes text file, and an executable a.out file.
